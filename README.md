# User Experience (UX)

## Initial Discussion

A gaming company wants to create a text based survival game.

### Key Information

* What is a text-based game?
* What is the story?
* What are the gameplay mechanics?

## User Stories

### Client Goals

* To make the game accessible across all devices.
* To allow players to easily understand how to play.
* The player is rewarded for interactivity.

### First Time Visitor Goals

* I want to learn the controls easily.
* I want to understand the UI being displayed. 

## Returning Visitor Goals

* I want to continue where I stopped playing before. 
* I want to find out something new within the game. 

## Frequent Visitor Goals 

* I want to check for any new or updated gameplay. 
* I want to complete the game.

# Design 

## Colour Scheme

The colour scheme chosen is based on depictions of hacking in media.

It gives the game a retro feel and makes up for the lack of images.

## Typography

Google Fonts was used to import the fonts for this project.

Handjet was chosen as it compliments the retro look and colours.
